# GetRadio-Web
This is the web app for https://larrytllama.github.io/GetRadio

## Why the Web app?
Currently the desktop app only supports the Windows 10 & 11 platforms. This way, people from multiple different platforms can join in with the action!

# What to do with this repo

## I want to listen to radio!
We've set up a page on https://getradio.glitch.me for listening - It's fully functional! 
Waiting for the app to load isn't ideal, so we're planning on migrating to https://app.cyclic.sh - The Beta version is at https://getradio.cyclic.app but currently doesn't support streaming the station!

## I want to run this!
1. Download NodeJS and clone this repo
2. Install dependencies with "npm install" in the command line, once navigated to the folder containing the cloned repo
3. Run node index.js
4. Head to your local PC address on port 3000 (often localhost:3000) in your browser and view the app! All requests should be logged to console
