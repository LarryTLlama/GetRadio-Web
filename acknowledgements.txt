In the code...
ElectronJS and the NodeJs Foundation (for app building stuff)
StackOverflow for a ton of answers and code snippets (too many to name)
Mpg123 - The GetRadio audio manager. Making the actual player possible!
radio-browser.info - The free open radio station api, for which none of this would be possible without!
Various packages from NPM:
axios (getting info from api)
discord-rpc (allowing us to share on discord)
edit-json-file (easy editing of the local settings stuff)
electron-packager (for making it an actual app)
node-internet-radio (fetching of song data reliably)
play-sound (allowing me to play the audio to the local audio player)

In the brand...
Coolvetica - A free font used in the GetRadio logo
Lato and Raleway fonts - From google fonts used throughout the app.
And all the radio stations for doing their thing, whatever their thing is!
